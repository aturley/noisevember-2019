# Noisevember 2019 -- Day 3

## Goal

Create a unit generator and use it to generate a signal.

## Result

I created a unit generator based on the CSound GEN1 generator. You
give it some points, it builds up the wave drawing lines between
points.

To build it:

```
ponyc
```

To run it:

```
./day-03 > out.aiff
```
