# Noisevember 2019 -- Day 4b

## Goal

Vary waveform as it runs by adjusting the frequency.

## Result

I reworked the way that I get samples from the unit generator so that
I can adjust the frequency as I read through it, and then I wrote some
code that modulates the frequence of an oscillator.

Building a system that lets me create instruments of graphs may be
more trouble that it is worth for what I want to do, so I think I'll
focus more on getting sounds out than on building fancy
infrastructure. If I change my mind I can always go back.
