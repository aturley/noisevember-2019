# Noisevember 2019 -- day 13

## Goal

Build a textured grain cloud based on the ideas in "Microsounds",
chapter 3.

## Result

I ended up building a cloud generator with some adjustable parameters:

* grain duration
* density
* frequency band
* amplitude band
* waveforms
* pan band
* left/right phase offset

I used this to create a 7 second cloud with a few shorter, higher
frequency clouds layered on top. It kind of sounds like R2D2 on a
windy day.
