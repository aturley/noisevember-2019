# Noisevember 2019 -- day 19

## Goal

[A 90 minute conceptual audio piece consisting solely of layered and distorted samples of Billy Joel singing the word "Berlin" on "We Didn't Start The Fire".](https://twitter.com/casio_juarez/status/951950468506374144)

## Result

Well, it is awful, and it isn't 90 minutes long, but otherwise it does
what it says on the tin.
